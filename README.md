# Coding Large Models (and components) from scratch

## What is this

This repo contains pyTorch code of different components of Large Models.

Currently, we roughly follow along the textbook: [Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch) -- Sebastian Raschka](https://www.amazon.com/Build-Large-Language-Model-Scratch/dp/1633437167), but will be implementing other papers in the future.
